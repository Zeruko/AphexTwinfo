# AphexTwinfo
Aphex Twin Fansite

This site was made to add to my portfolio and get used to using SASS.

Got more jQuery practise in here.


The page AphexTwinfoBio is a recreation of this page: https://warp.net/artists/aphex-twin/
  This was done to show that I can recreate a sites look and functionality from scratch.
  This was mostly achieved with some features like add track to bleep left out.
